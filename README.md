# CAEN_FADC_EAS

Online program for FADC manufactured by CAEN.

Written in C on the base of standard CAEN software

There are two programs developed for two different working modes: 

1) triggering by single pulses

That mode allows to simultaneously measure events and background variations 

2) triggering by at least N coinciding pulses 

That mode allows to reduce background and have whole long oscillogram of about 3 - 8 ms with 32 ns sampling
